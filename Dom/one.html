        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface<br> that treats an HTML or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object<br> representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.<br> Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods<br> allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style<br> or content of a document.[2] Nodes can have event handlers (also known as event<br> listeners) attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.[3]</p>
